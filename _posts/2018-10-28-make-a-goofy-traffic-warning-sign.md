Cat recently made a pair of polar-bear-paw-gloves for Halloween. They also have holes where she can stick her fingers out for coding.

So I think it would be cool and goofy to make her a traffic warning sign similar to the one below but with "polar bear" and "coding".

I found this awesome polar bear paw image on [Clipart Library](https://clipart-library.com/clipart/yckKar5xi.htm).

And I drew this simple keyboard art (because I can't find one I like online).

Put them all together and add a "[fish](https://www.flaticon.com)-mouse", we get
