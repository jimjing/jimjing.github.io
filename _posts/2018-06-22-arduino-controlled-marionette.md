Recently I helped a couple of artists design and made the electronic system for their Arduino controlled marionette project.
The marionette is connected to 10 stepper motors and 2 DC motors through fishing lines and the motion is controlled by an Arduino Due board.
I also wrote an arduino program and a Python GUI for easy testing the marionette motion.
Since the art project is published yet, I could not disclose more information of the system, but here are a couple of photos of the work-in-progress electronic system.

I will post more information once the art project is published.
