I always want a drill press.
Unfortunately, living in a small apartment makes it impossible to get a full size drill press.
When looking for small drill press online I found this [workstation](https://www.dremel.com/en_US/products/-/show-product/tools/220-01-workstation) for my [Dremel 3000](https://www.dremel.com/products/-/show-product/tools/3000-variable-speed-rotary-tool).
Although many reviews from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Dremel-220-01-Rotary-Workstation-Station/dp/B00068P48O) suggest that it is not very accurate/stable due to its plastic parts, I decided to give it a try.

As I was planning to mainly drill small wood cubes/strips and plastic enclosures, I want to make a cover for the workstation to keep all dust/chips contained.
I first used some paint stir sticks and 3/16" wood dowels to make a simple rectangular frame.

Then I got a transparent shower curtain and some hooks to wrap sides of the frame.

The final result looks like this.

Also I used some 1/4" bolts, wing nuts, and large washers to make some hold down clamps.
